### This is the fornt_end of the interview task
    1. Framework: vue and element UI.
    2. You can checkout the code & execute “npm install & npm run dev” to run this app,
      I have configed the proxy to redirect api access to backend app deployed in aws already.
    3. Cause of time & cloud computing resources limitation I didn’t create the pipline
      for front end part. Sorry for that.
    4. If possible I will create a dockerfile for this app and adopt aws ECS service to make our deployment easier.
